# see - A Minimal, Cross-Platform `cat` Implementation

`see` is a command-line utility designed as a superior alternative to the
traditional `cat` command for concatenating files to standard output.

## Overview

The core philosophy behind `see` is to create a tool that is extremely
efficient, reliable, and resource-friendly. It handles both text and binary
data flawlessly, emphasizing simplicity and robustness in its design and
implementation.

## Key Features

*   **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and efficient I/O operations.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Compiles and runs on a wide range of operating systems
    (including Windows, Linux, macOS) with any standard C compiler.
*   **Minimal Binary Size:** Engineered to produce the smallest possible
    executable.
*   **Standard Input/Output:** Reads from specified files or standard input,
    writing to standard output.
*   **Binary Safe:** Correctly processes all types of data without modification.
*   **Self-Contained:** Implemented in a single C source file with no external
    dependencies beyond standard C libraries.

## Design Principles

*   **Efficiency:** Prioritizing speed and minimal resource consumption through
    optimized algorithms and I/O handling.
*   **Reliability:** Robust error handling and predictable behavior across all
    supported platforms and scenarios.
*   **Minimalism:** A focused feature set, avoiding bloat and unnecessary
    complexity.
*   **Portability:** Adherence to C standards and careful consideration of
    platform-specific details to ensure wide compatibility.
