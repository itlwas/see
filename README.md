# see

A minimal, cross-platform file content display utility.

## Overview

`see` is a command-line utility for concatenating and displaying file contents to standard output, designed as an alternative to the traditional `cat` command. It focuses on efficiency, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

- Efficient I/O operations with 64KB buffer optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Binary file support with no content modification
- UTF-8 output handling on Windows
- Proper binary mode I/O to prevent CRLF translation
- Graceful handling of broken pipes
- Self-contained implementation in a single C source file

## Usage

```
Usage: see [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Options:
  -h, --help     display this help
  -v, --version  output version information
```

## Examples

Display a file:
```
see filename.txt
```

Concatenate multiple files:
```
see file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```

Use as part of a pipeline:
```
see file.txt | grep "pattern"
```

## Installation

### Build from Source

Requirements:
- C compiler supporting C89 standard
- Make (optional)

Using make:
```
make
```

Manual compilation:
```
gcc -std=c89 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -s -o see src/see.c
```

## Implementation Details

- Written in C89 for maximum compatibility
- Uses optimal 64KB buffer size for disk I/O operations
- Platform-specific adaptations for Windows and POSIX systems
- Handles binary data correctly across platforms
- Minimal binary size through careful optimization
